### Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

#### Hash Tables:
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup through the use of a hash code function. Note that two different keys could have the same hash code, as there may be an infinite number of keys and a finite number of ints. If the number of collisions is very high, the worst case runtime is `O(N)`; generally, lookup time is `O(1)`.

#### ArrayList & Resizable Arrays
ArrayLists (and resizable arrays) have amortized insertion time of `O(1)`.

#### StringBuilder
Naively concatenating n strings runs in `O(xn^2)`, assuming that all strings have a length of `x`. On each concatenation, a new copy of the string is created. `Stringbuilder` simply creates a resizable array of all the strings, copying them back to a string only when necessary.

### Chapter 2: Linked Lists 
Benefit of linked list over array is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time.

#### Creating a Linked List
The code below implements a very basic singly linked list.

```java
class Node {
    Node next = null;
    int data;

    public Node(int d) {
        data = d;
    }

    void appendToTail(int d) {
        Node end = new Node(d);
        Node n = this;

        while (n.next != null) {
            n = n.next;
        }
        n.next = end;
    }
}
```

#### Deleting a Node from a Singly Linked List
Given a node `n`, we find the previous node `prev` and set `prev.next` equal to `n.next`. If the list is doubly linked, we must also update `n.next` to set `n.next.prev` equal to `n.prev`. Important things to remember:
1. Check for the null pointer.
2. Update the head or tail pointer as necessary.

```java
public class Node {
    ...
    Node deleteNode(Node head, int d) {
        Node n = head;

        if (n.data == d)
            return head.next; /* moved head */

        while (n.next != null) {
            if (n.next.data == d) {
                n.next = n.next.next;
                return head; /* head didn't change */
            }
            n = n.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
    ...
}
```


#### The "Runner" Technique
The runner technique means that you iterate through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead of the other. The "fast" node might be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might be hopping multipke nodes for each one node that the "slow" node iterates through.

#### Recursive Problems
Explained in further detail later one. Recursive algorithms take at least `O(n)` space, where `n` is the depth of the recursive call.
